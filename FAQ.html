                                        How do we buy skate tickets for General Admission?<br>
                                        A:</strong>
                                    General Admission skating is on a first come, first serve basis. If there is a line,
                                    everyone in your party must wait in line together to purchase tickets.

                                    Our peak holiday season is from Friday November 7th through January 6th and during
                                    this time period, lines are likely to be long for all sessions. During the busy
                                    holiday season you should anticipate an approximate one hour wait. Please note that
                                    you do wait outdoors.

                                    We recommend coming for our early 8:30 am – 10 am session if possible - lines are
                                    typically shortest first thing in the morning.

                                    To avoid the lines completely, you may now make reservations to skate through our
                                    VIP SKATE or FIRST SKATE packages.<br>

                                    You can do this one of two ways:
                                    1) Send it to us using any mail carrier service available that will provide you with
                                    a "proof of signature" option. (We recommend FedEx or UPS). This ensures that your
                                    magical song gets safely into our hands. Should your CD be lost in transit, we
                                    cannot accept responsibility for this and want to make this a truly special day for
                                    you. For this option, please send to:

                                    your skate session. For example, if you book a 10:30 AM session, you will make your
                                    proposal at 12PM. In preparation for your proposal, we will take a few minutes to
                                    clear everyone from the ice (except you).<br>

                                    that are available for parties of 5 or more. This allows all of our guests to be
                                    accommodated. When you are booking on our webcart, your reservation maybe declined
                                    if the size of your request is too large of a group for that date. Please enter your
